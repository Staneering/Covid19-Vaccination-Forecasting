# Covid19-Vaccination-Forecasting

## **Project Description: COVID-19 Vaccination Rate Forecasting with ARIMA Model**

**Objective:**

To develop an accurate forecasting model for COVID-19 vaccination rates using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) time series model. The model will leverage COVID-19 data from the OWID dataset to predict future vaccination trends.

**Methodology:**

1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:**
   * Collect relevant COVID-19 vaccination data from the OWID dataset, including daily vaccination rates, population, and other potential influencing factors.
   * Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data consistency.
   * Perform time series decomposition to identify trends, seasonality, and residuals.

2. **Model Selection and Training:**
   * Employ the ARIMA model to capture the temporal dependencies and patterns in the vaccination rate data.
   * Utilize techniques like ACF (Autocorrelation Function) and PACF (Partial Autocorrelation Function) to determine the appropriate ARIMA parameters (p, d, q).
   * Train the ARIMA model on the historical vaccination data to learn the underlying patterns and relationships.

3. **Model Evaluation and Validation:**
   * Assess the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
   * Employ cross-validation techniques to evaluate the model's generalization ability and prevent overfitting.

4. **Forecasting:**
   * Utilize the trained ARIMA model to generate predictions for future vaccination rates based on the historical data.
   * Analyze the forecasted trends and identify potential implications for public health policies and resource allocation.

**Expected Outcomes:**

* Accurate and reliable forecasts of COVID-19 vaccination rates.
* Insights into the factors influencing vaccination trends and their potential implications.
* A valuable tool for policymakers and public health officials in making informed decisions regarding vaccination campaigns and resource allocation.

**Potential Applications:**

* **Public Health Planning:** Assist in planning vaccination campaigns and allocating resources effectively.
* **Policy Making:** Inform decision-making regarding vaccination mandates, incentives, and other interventions.
* **Research:** Contribute to understanding the factors driving vaccination uptake and developing more effective vaccination strategies.
