**Title: COVID-19 Vaccination Rate Forecasting with ARIMA Model: A Regional Analysis**

**Objective:**

To develop a comprehensive ARIMA-based forecasting model for COVID-19 vaccination rates, tailored to specific regions. This project will analyze vaccination data from various regions, including Egypt and Kenya, to provide accurate and region-specific predictions.

**Methodology:**

1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:**
   * Collect COVID-19 vaccination data from the OWID dataset for the target regions (Egypt, Kenya, etc.).
   * Clean and preprocess the data to ensure consistency and handle missing values.
   * Perform time series decomposition to identify trends, seasonality, and residuals.

2. **Regional Model Development:**
   * Develop separate ARIMA models for each region, considering the unique characteristics and factors influencing vaccination rates in each area.
   * Utilize ACF and PACF to determine optimal ARIMA parameters for each region.
   * Train the models on the corresponding regional data to capture region-specific patterns.

3. **Model Evaluation and Validation:**
   * Evaluate the performance of each regional model using appropriate metrics (MSE, MAE, RMSE).
   * Employ cross-validation techniques to assess the models' generalization ability.

4. **Forecasting and Analysis:**
   * Generate vaccination rate forecasts for each region using the trained ARIMA models.
   * Analyze the regional variations in forecasting accuracy and identify factors contributing to differences.
   * Compare the forecasted trends across regions to gain insights into regional disparities and potential implications.

**Project Structure:**

* **Data:** A directory containing the collected COVID-19 vaccination data for each region.
* **Notebooks:** Separate Jupyter notebooks for each region, containing the data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and forecasting steps.
* **Results:** A directory to store the model outputs, visualizations, and analysis results.

**Expected Outcomes:**

* Accurate and region-specific forecasts of COVID-19 vaccination rates.
* Insights into the factors influencing vaccination trends in different regions.
* A valuable resource for public health officials and policymakers in making informed decisions tailored to specific regional contexts.

**Note:** This project can be extended to include additional regions and explore other forecasting models, such as Prophet or SARIMA, to further enhance the accuracy and robustness of the predictions.
